# There has been a lot of discussion on the forum about whether or not
# to make the plot backgrounds white or transparent. The reference
# plots do in fact have a transparent background, but appear white
# when rendered in the README which is the first thing people see.
# That said, I've chosen to produce both backgrounds, but to use
# the white bg images as the primary files (plot[1-4].png). The
# transparent images can be found in transparent/plot[1-4]-trans.png.
#
# My rationale:
#
# a) Peers who are not familiar with transparency may be confused by
#    the checkerboard background rendered by github (and most image
#    viewing software) that transparency brings
# b) People that care about transparency can see that I realize the
#    issue and know how to treat it.
# c) In reality, I believe a white background to be more approprite
#    for these plots.
